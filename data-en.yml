  motto: >
    I'm a programmer who believes that writing clean code and good system designs are the foundation for building a successful application. 
    However, writing quality code is only half the battle. 
    Communicating your ideas with the team and stakeholders, and being able to adapt based on their feedback, is just as important, if not more so.
